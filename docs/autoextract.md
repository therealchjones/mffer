Obtaining and extracting data files from Marvel Future Fight

Create a package of files for the latest release of Marvel Future Fight

By default, does not modify system beyond temporary directories; this
therefore requires new downloads of all components upon each run.

Requirements:

-   POSIX-compliant Unix-like environment for which all the used
    programs are available (likely MacOS/OS X, Windows with Cygwin or
    another POSIX layer, or Linux). Of specific note, the Android Virtual
    Devices used may not run correctly on emulated systems such as
    Parallels or VirtualBox.
-   Internet connection with access to Google developer tools, Google
    Play Store, Netmarble servers, and Facebook
-   An installed version of Android command-line tools (also included in
    Android Studio)
-   Java (required by Android command-line tools)
-   A Google account (to log into the Play store)
-   A Facebook or Google account to which your Marvel Future Fight game
    is synchronized (to download personal game data)
-   A reasonable machine upon which to run these; the emulators require
    a few GB of RAM just by themselves, for instance
