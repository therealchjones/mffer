# Meta-documentation

## README

### My ideas/notes

-   shields? minimal? (see below comment about "old school manuals") maybe at the bottom or under standards or something like that? Have to determine whether this makes things useful at a glance or is more "marketing" which doesn't need to be there. See also https://shields.io
-   2 different versions (in / and /docs), one "at-a-glance" and one "index" for documentation/overview

### https://dev.to/scottydocs/how-to-write-a-kickass-readme-5af9

-   informs people what the project does (https://dev.to/scottydocs/how-to-write-a-kickass-readme-5af9)
-   who the project is for (https://dev.to/scottydocs/how-to-write-a-kickass-readme-5af9)
-   how to use the project (https://dev.to/scottydocs/how-to-write-a-kickass-readme-5af9)
-   name the thing
-   introduction or summary (2 or 3 lines, what it does and who it is for, without "Introduction", "Summary", or "Overview")
-   Prerequisites (knowledge, tools)
-   How to install
-   How to use (CLI options, etc, link to another file)
-   link to CONTRIBUTING
-   contributors, acknowledgments
-   contact info
-   license
-   (in a comment) Take a cue from those same old school manuals you reference as to what they include. Who cares about badges and emojis. That's marketing. Put marketing on your site. This is about getting shit done
