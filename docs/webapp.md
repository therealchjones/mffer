## Description

The `mffer` webapp presents [`mffer`](mffer.md)-extracted data in a format to help with in-game decision making. As of this writing, functionality is limited or nonexistent.

## Requirements

The `mffer` webapp is built on Google Apps Script and uses Google Sheets as a data store; it may not be functional without a Google account. It also requires a web browser with robust JavaScript support for most functionality. An Internet connection is required to use the webapp; it does not have an "offline" mode.
