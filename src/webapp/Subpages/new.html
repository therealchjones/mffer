			mffer is designed to be run as a web app on the Google Cloud

			If you just want to use the web app, you don't need to do this: just
			visit <a href="https://mffer.org">mffer.org</a>.

			<a href="https://dev.mffer.org">dev.mffer.org</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if you want to modify and test the web app or deploy a
			version yourself, then
