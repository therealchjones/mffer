			<code>mffer</code> is designed to be run as a web app on the Google
			Cloud Platform. To deploy the application as a project of your own,
			you must register it as an OAuth 2.0 client, add your own API key,
			and set up a Google Sheet for storage.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you just want to use the web app, you don't need to do this: just
			visit <a href="https://mffer.org">mffer.org</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to run, build, modify, or test the command-line
			<code>mffer</code> program, which is used for extracting data and
			reporting it in a way the web app can use, you may not need to do
			this: visit
			<a href="https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer"
				><code>mffer</code> on GitHub</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if you want to modify and test the web app or deploy a
			version yourself, then
