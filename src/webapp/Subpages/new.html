		<h2>Welcome.</h2>
		<p>
			<code>mffer</code> is designed to be run as a web app on the Google
			Cloud Platform. To deploy the application as a project of your own,
			you must register it as an Oauth 2.0 client, add your own API key,
			and set up a Google Sheet for storage.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you just want to use the web app, you don't need to do this: just
			visit <a href="https://mffer.org">mffer.org</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to run, build, modify, or test the command-line
			<code>mffer</code> program, which is used for extracting data and
			reporting it in a way the web app can use, you may not need to do
			this: visit
			<a href="https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer"
				><code>mffer</code> on GitHub</a
			>.
		</p>
		<form>
			<p>
				However, if you want to modify and test the web app or deploy a
				version yourself, then
			</p>
			<button id="button-start-new-deployment" type="button">
				Get Started
			</button>
		</form>

		<h2>Are Google Apps Script and Google Cloud Platform set up?</h2>
		<p>
			They're probably at least <em>partly</em> configured if you've
			gotten this far. For the webapp to work properly, you'll need to
			ensure those are complete by following the
			<a
				href="http://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/docs/Deployment.md#deploying-the-webapp"
				target="_blank"
				>"Deploying the webapp" instructions</a
			>
			in the
			<a
				href="http://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/docs/Deployment.md"
				target="_blank"
				><code>mffer</code> Development Guide</a
			>. Once you've completed that, enter the identifiers from the
			"Credentials" section of your project below.
		</p>
		<p>
			After submitting the below keys, you *may* be asked to sign into
			your Google account and allow appropriate access for the app. Check
			the permissions request carefully and ensure you're using the
			account that manages your Google Cloud Platform project.
