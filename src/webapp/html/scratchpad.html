	TODO
	Needs
	- next/success on floor 30 doesn't work (prompt?)
	- reloading after completing 30 gives an error

	Wants
	- move to standalone script/library/webapp
	- keep stuff up-to-date in additionalDatabase and use as needed:
	  completed floors this week (done)
	  sheet floor/current floor (near beginning of reset page)
	  Used characters (done)
	  Preference values (already synchronizing back, can update
	  additionaldatabase at the same time)
	  current floor stuff (team members?, opponent selections) along with
	  synchronizing to sheet
	- Record for this week to fill in read-only floors or keep them blank when filling
		in prior floors (need to add this to the shadowlanddatabase and keep
		in additionaldatabase as well
	- MFF theme/colors
	- notes section to save when appropriate with successes
	- incorporate uniform variations
	- better console/messaging system
	- could be necessary under some circumstances for server requests
	  to arrive out of order, e.g., when setting multiple preferences.
	  Do we need some sort of messaging queue?
	- having disabled drop downs is annoying. Just enable all from the start.
	- make progress notes/messages nice in the footer bar and available "console"
	- would it save time and/or make it more intuitive to transpose() the
	  shadowlandDatabase prior to sending from server?
	- change 'halt's/'return false's to proper error handling
	- when some things are changed (floor, enemies, teammembers, preferences),
	  sync changes back to server; maybe just always do this in resetPage
	  and/or updateRecommendations?) (anything saved to additionalDatabase,
	  if not calculated elsewhere, as well as visible things on sheet if not calculated elsewhere)
	- figure out when to best update stuff in additionalDatabase; anytime
	  sending stuff back to server, others? resetPage vs getCurrentFloor?
	  remember to set things only when actually true---e.g., if I set the floor
	  to 14, that doesn't necessarily mean I've completed 13, so shouldn't set
	  "last completed" to 13. Rather, set last completed to 13 when I submit
	  success for 13.
	- make mobile responsive, viewable/usable on phone
	  - maybe options button on header bar instead of separate section? Or is
		it too frequently needed?
	- disable up/down buttons for floor 1/30 as appropriate
	- consider adding uniform information to record/save
	- review previous floors by visiting those floors, but make form un-editable/savable
	- how do i do field focus? (https://medium.theuxblog.com/10-best-practices-for-designing-user-friendly-forms-fa0ba7c3e01f, point 4)
	- if I put something outside the <form> (like in the toolbar), use the form= attribute
	- check and update/erase/retry progress messages the right way
	- start recording the floors after 30; will need a new field, "base floor" upon which the floor > 30 is based

    TODO
automatically show available good/meta/teams?
Recommended Teams:
prior success
likely success
experimental


Finish inputting character info


/***
TODO:
- sidebar for important content on pages, especially for pages like Heroic Quests where you have to scroll a lot
- - base it on active sheet instead of what is clicked on? Unsure how to generate "dynamic" content that doesn't
- - involve clicking on a link, such as time based or when clicking on a tab
- anything here that needs much of an interface (like the calculators) should be deployed as web apps instead
- make stuff into more manageable included script files and/or libraries? (Apparently all share namespace, can just
have multiple .gs files?
- refactor, starting with webapp, more modular, in different files
- would like to find some way to code in better editor, maybe xcode?

	Of note, scripts seem to appropriately wait until the spreadsheet has finished calculating before getting values
tested this with a "test calc" loop that took several seconds to run, which caused the script to take several seconds,
but it returned the right (new) value
