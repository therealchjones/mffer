# Contributing to `mffer`

Guidelines, notes, and tips for maintaining and adding to the mffer project

Any questions, comments, or concerns can be posted in the [GitHub repository's
issues list](https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/issues) or emailed to the

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in this project. Contributions of any kind are
welcome, but most useful to the project are bug reports and possible fixes.
Whether you find a problem that you can fix or not, however, you can send
feedback; follow, fork, or star the project on [GitHub](https://github.com);
tell others about the project; or just use the project yourself.

This document includes information ranging from
[appropriate behavoirs when contributing to the project](#behavioral-expectations)
to [general instructions for contributing](#so-youve-got-this-idea). It does
not include many technical details, such as the project design, coding styles,
or recommended tools. (For those, dive into the
[Development Guide](Development.md).) For information about the `mffer` project
that's not directly related to making contributions, check the
[User Guide](USAGE.md).

## Quick Questions & Answers

-   Where should I report bugs, request new or changed features, or ask for more help?

    The [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/issues/) is
    just fine for all of these things. Your "issue" doesn't have to be
    perfect---others can ask for more details as needed.

-   I don't know how to program, so how can I help?

    Answer questions on the [GitHub issues
    page](https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/issues/), make edits to
    [documentation](README.md), or just offer a kind word.

-   What format should I use for a pull request?

    The best format is "submitted"! Ask questions, expect feedback and changes, and
    please submit PRs even when you're still working on them. For the nitty-gritty
    details of coding style, merge types, and so on, please refer to the
    [development guide](Development.md).

-   What's a "pull request"?

    Ah, you're new to git and its style of shared development. Welcome! I'm glad
    you're here. There's _lots_ of information available to get you started.
    [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io) is one place to
    learn the general process of the "fork-clone-edit-pull request" workflow.
    For plenty more details, try
    [Getting Started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github).

## Behavioral Expectations

The abilities needed to effectively contribute to an open source project are
complex, intertwined, and widely varying. None, however, is more important than
the ability to work with others kindly. People are different. Respect and
celebrate those differences. Failure to do so will result in being asked to
cease interactions with the project and reporting your account to
[GitHub](https://github.com). Disrespectful comments will be edited or removed.
Any concerns may be addressed to the project maintainer, <chjones@aleph0.com>.

While this is the guiding spirit of the contributions to the project, the
project has formally adopted the
[Contributor Covenant 2.0](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In addition, users and
visitors are expected to follow the
[GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)
and the
[GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service).
None of these documents is intended to allow or encourage behavior disallowed or
discouraged by the others.

Let's do better.

## So you've got this idea...

Wonderful! Think about it a bit. Try to explicitly define (even if just
mentally) what it is you're trying to do and how. Then take a look at the
[GitHub issues page](https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/issues/) and search
for ideas like yours---someone else may have already made progress, run into
problems that need to be fixed first, or had a discussion about alternate
methods that could be better. That's great! Minds working together, even
asynchronously, produce excellent results.

Post an issue yourself talking about your idea. Start discussing it openly;
there's not a great benefit in "saving up" until your idea is near completion
(or you're stuck). Even if you don't know exactly how to do what you want,
others may be able to point you in the right direction.

Take a look at the [Development Guide](Development.md), and figure out how your
idea best fits into the project: should you edit some documentation, write a
program that uses the `mffer` library, or write a better algorithm for reading
from the filesystem? This may also lead you to browsing the
[source code](https://github.com/therealchjones/mffer/) or reviewing the API.

Fork the project, make the changes you want, ensure it works the way you think
it should (and doesn't break anything else) and submit a pull request to merge
your new code with the main project. It's okay if it's not perfect or even
finished; once you submit a PR the code can be reviewed by others and you can
make more changes before the final version is added to `main`.

Finally, bask in the warmth that comes from making a contribution to your
compatriots. Celebrate your inquisitiveness and industriousness. Enjoy your
creation.

And maybe you have another idea...
