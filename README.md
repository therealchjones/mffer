Marvel Future Fight exploration & reporting

This project develops software that creates and updates the
[mffer webapp](https://mffer.org).

[Marvel Future Fight](http://www.marvelfuturefight.com/) (MFF) is a mobile game
for Android and iOS created with Java, C#, Unity, and IL2CPP. It uses multiple
common services for authentication and proprietary servers for data storage and
communication.

mffer facilitates analysis of the Marvel Future Fight application
and provides access to the data it uses for game play. The mffer project and its
maintainer are not affiliated with Marvel Future Fight, its creators and owners,
or their affiliates.

The project includes:

-   a [shell script](https://dev.mffer.org/apkdl) to obtain the Marvel Future Fight
    program files
-   a [shell script](https://dev.mffer.org/autoanalyze) to decompile and analyze the program
    files
-   a [command line program](https://dev.mffer.org/mffer) to obtain and parse the data files,
    analyze the data, and output information in an open and usable format
-   a [web app](https://mffer.org/) to present and use the game data

More information about using and developing mffer is available at
